Xremote
-------

This little utility is able to grab inputs from local X server
to forward them on a remote X server.

It uses IPv4/UDP sockets, XTest extension and Xlib. For
encryption it uses SHA-256 hash and AES-256 cipher.

Installation
------------

    make clean
    make
    make install

The default isntallation directory is :

    /usr/local/bin

See the makefile. Or just copy xremote by yourself.


Usage
-----

    xremote [-p] --client serverhost [serverport]
    xremote [-p] --server listenhost [listenport]

The -p argument means that the encryption password will be
provided from standard input stream. The password is the
first line of text found in input stream. For exemple :

    cat mypwd.txt | xremote -p --client 192.168.1.1

When the pointer reach the left or right border of the local
display, the client try to contact the server. If the server
answer correctely, the local input devices are actively
grabbed and every key/pointer event is sent to the server.
The server repeat key/pointer events as they are received.
If the pointer reach the left or right border of the remtoe
display, the server contact the client to release the grab
and the client comes back to a local input mode.

For exemple left and right borders means with three screens :

       DISPLAY
    -------------
    | 0 | 1 | 2 |
    -------------

The left border is the x coordinate 0 on screen 0, the right
border is x coordinate (width-1) on screen 2.

The pointer switching works as described here :

        LOCAL
       DISPLAY
    -------------
    | 0 | 1 | 2 |
    -------------

       REMOTE
       DISPLAY
    -------------
    | 0 | 1 | 2 |
    -------------

L0 -> L1 -> L2 -> R0 -> R1 -> R2 -> L0
L0 <- L1 <- L2 <- R0 <- R1 <- R2 <- L0


Default parameters
------------------

The client-side UDP port is fixed to :

    #define XREMOTE_CLIENT_PORT  9875	

The server-side UDP port is fixed to :

    #define XREMOTE_SERVER_PORT  9876

The default client-side listen host is fixed to :

TODO
----

- [high] Use keysym (more portable) instead of keycode.

- [high] Merge switchscreen utility with this one to quickly
         change active screen among local and remote displays.

- [high] Synchronize client screensaver with servers

- [low] Allows multiple servers per client

- [low] Provide a way to get/configure screen layouts
